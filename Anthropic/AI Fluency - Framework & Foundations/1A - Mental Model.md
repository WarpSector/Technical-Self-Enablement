# The AI Fluency Framework (4 D's)
### The AI Fluency (4D) Framework is designed to ensure we approach AI as a collaborative partner and not just a tool.
#### The 4D Framework consists of four (4) interconnected competency areas where we apply skills, knowledge, insights, and values to ensure our interactions with AI are EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT, ETHICAL, and SAFE.
  * `EFFECTIVE` so our work with the AI heightens and augments what we already do.
  * `EFFICIENT` so it makes us better and much more streamlined at what we already do.
  * `ETHICAL` so that we do not plagarize or overly-commoditize our own work and the work of others.
  * `SAFE` so we hold ourselves accountable for the output of our interactions and do not cause any harm with our use of AI.

# Delegation
### What YOU will do. What the AI will do. What you and the AI will do together. And how the tasks will be delegated.

#### For DELEGATION to be effective, you must define the following:
  * `PROBLEM AWARENESS:` You must clearly define your goals and what you want to do before engaging with an AI.
  * `PLATFORM AWARENESS:` You must understand the capabilities and limitations of the AI model you are working with.
  * `TASK DELEGATION:` You must think about what you (as the domain expert) will do and what the AI (your junior developer, assistant, or thought partner) will do before delegating these tasks. 

### Effective delegation requires both domain expertise and knowledge of the capabilities of AI.

# Description
### Developing and applying your ability to COMMUNICATE with the AI to create a productive and collaborative environment.

#### For DESCRIPTION to be effective, you must practice the following:
  * `PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:` You must clearly define what you want in terms of outputs, audience, format, and style. 
  * `PROCESS DESCRIPTION:` You must define how the AI approaches your request, such as providing step-by-step instructions for the AI to follow.
  * `PERFORMANCE DESCRIPTION:` You must define how the AI should behave during the collaboration, such as defining whether it should be concise vs. detailed or challeging vs. supportive.

### Using these Six Techniques for Effective Prompting will hone your DESCRIPTION practice.
  * `PROVIDE CONTEXT:` Be specific about what you want. Provide details about scope, context, background information, geography, timeframe, and other relevant parameters.
  * `SHOW "GOOD" EXAMPLES:` Providing examples demonstrates to the AI the pattern, style, and/or format you are looking for much better than typing in descriptors (re: *N-Shot Prompting*).
  * `SPECIFY OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:` As important as it is to tell the AI what you want, it is equally as important to specify anything you do not want.
  * `BREAK COMPLEX TASKS INTO STEPS:` Breaking down complex tasks into steps ensures the AI's reasoning process is clear and that it provides thorough, methodical responses.
  * `ASK IT TO THINK FIRST:` Simply asking the AI to think before responding encourages deeper, more comprehensive, and thoughtful responses (re: *Think-First Approach*).
  * `DEFINE THE AI'S ROLE:` Define the role, tone, or style the AI should take. This will help you shape its approach to fit your specific needs and audience.
#### The Secret Weapon:
  * Ask the AI how best to engineer the prompt after giving it the goal(s) you are trying to achieve!

# Discernment
### You thoughtfully and critically evaluate what the AI produces, how it produces it, and how it behaves.

#### For DISCERNMENT to be effective, you must practice the following:
  * `PRODUCT DISCERNMENT:` You must evaluate the quality of what the AI produces, focusing on the accuracy, appropriateness, relevance, and coherence of the output.
  * `PROCESS DISCERNMENT:` You must evaluate how the AI arrived at the output by looking for errors (hallucinations), lapses in attention, or inappropriate reasoning steps (re: use *Chain of Thought* heuristics in your prompt so you can inspect how the AI arrived at its output).
  * `PERFORMANCE DISCERNMENT:` You must evaluate how the AI behaves during your interaction and consider whether its communication style is effective for your needs.

# Description and Discernment are Mirrors

### DESCRIPTION focuses on the INPUT. DISCERNMENT focuses on the OUTPUT.
#### These two interconnected competencies are in a feedback loop allowing you to fine-tune your DESCRIPTION in order for the output to pass your DISCERNMENT.

---

# Diligence
### Use AI responsible and ethically. Be thoughtful about how you use it and be transparent about its use. Take accountability for AI-assisted work.

#### To practice DILIGENCE, you must take into account:
  * `CREATION DILIGENCE:` Be thoughtful about which AI systems you use and how you interact with them (re: enterpise AI vs. personal AI, data privacy and protection).
  * `TRANSPARENCY DILIGENCE:` Be honest about how you used AI in your work with everyone who needs to know (e.g., stakeholders).
  * `DEPLOYMENT DILIGENCE:` Being accountable and responsible for the outputs by verifying and validating them (re: *Human-in-the-Loop Validation*).

---

# The Three Modes of Interaction
### AI is generally used in these three ways:
  * `AUTOMATION:` AI will execute specific tasks based on human instructions.
  * `AUGMENTATION:` AI and humans collaborate as thought partners to augment, refine, or enhance the work the human is doing. 
  * `AGENCY:` Humans configure AI to execute complex step-by-step tasks on their behalf (re: agentic AI).
