## Applying AI Fluency (4D Framework) to Augment Course Design and Learning Outcomes

### Notes on how the 4D Framework is applied to Course Design
  * Building new courses from scratch
  * Updating existing courses
  * Planning curriculum sequences
  * Developing learning pathways

### Overarching Course Design Activities
  * Let's assume you've scoped out the goal of the course and the problem/challege it solves. You've also scoped out who the audience.
  * We'll start with `identifying the concepts` that need to be taught/transferred to the learners.
  * Next, we'll design the `learning journey` by architecting an instructional blueprint that moves the learners from current state to future state.
  * We'll also articulate specific, measurable `learning objectives` that learners will achieve by the end of the course.


### Applying AI Fluency to Identifying Concepts
#### Delegation
  * Need to decide what I'm doing with the AI and why.
    * Ex: Maybe I already have a few high-level topics in mind. I just need help drilling down on those concepts to an appropriately granular level (apply the ID framework of 4-MAT here: answering `WHAT`, `WHY`, `HOW`, and `WHAT IF`.). I'll list the concept and delegate the task of breaking the concept down following the 4-MAT structure to the AI.
  * I need to know the specific needs and the goal to delegate tasks effectively.
#### Description
  * **Invite** the AI into the conversation.
  * Use the [6 prompting techniques](../AI%20Fluency%20-%20Framework%20&%20Foundations/6_Effective_Prompting_Techniques.pdf)
  * Ex: **Prompt:** I'm building an AI Fluency course for fellow IDs and L&D professionals who need AI fluency, but may be new to AI and anxious about integrating it into their workflows and design processes. Help me think through how identifying concepts that will address these concerns while building confidence.
#### Discernment
  * As the AI generates ideas, this is where I evaluate the product, process, and performance of the AI against my own ID and domain expertise.
  * I act as the `human` in the `human-in-the-loop` validation.
  * I will engage in the *Description <--> Discernment* bridge refining input to achieve maximal output.
#### Diligence
  * I will take responsibility for what ends up in front of the learners and stakeholders.
  * I'm not outsourcing the decisions, I am the ultimate validator.
  * Document key decisions for responsible AI collaboration.

### Applying AI Fluency to Mapping a Learning Journey
#### Delegation
  * Need to decide what work can be augmented with AI.
#### Description
  * Explain in detail what the AI must do, what I'd like to see, provide clear background and context, and ask how the AI formulated the response (re: CoT or Step-by-Step analysis).
#### Discernment
  * Evaluate the response, discern problems and identify unexpected variables in the response.
  * Iterate on the prompt engineering.
#### Diligence
  * Remember, this is the part where YOU apply QA, responsibility, and transparency.

### SECRET WEAPON: You can ask the AI to switch roles!
  * Ask the AI to take on the role of a learner.
  * Ask it to react to the learning pathway at different points along the way.
  * Ask it if it gets confused at any point and what would help it not get confused at that specific point.
  * Ask it what additional context or background it needs at each stage of the learning path.
  * Ask it what support it needs for transitioning between topics.
  * This is like having a student focus group at any time.

### Applying AI Fluency to Learning Objectives
#### Overview
  * After idenfitying core concepts (and applying 4-MAT), mapping the learning path, you can ask the AI to help you write meaningful, measurable learning objectives.
  * You can map objectives to specific skills the learner will develop.

### Conculsion
#### Collaborating with AI will:
  * Surface hidden assumptions and blindspots in your own thinking.
  * Discover creative connections between concepts that may otherwise have been missed.
  * Maintain coherence while exploring new ideas.
  * Build personal competencies that get stronger with practice.
