## Applying AI Fluency (4D Framework) to Augment Course Design and Learning Outcomes

### Notes on how the 4D Framework is applied to Course Design
  * Building new courses from scratch
  * Updating existing courses
  * Planning curriculum sequences
  * Developing learning pathways

### Overarching Course Design Activities
  * Let's assume you've scoped out the goal of the course and the problem/challege it solves. You've also scoped out who the audience.
  * We'll start with `identifying the concepts` that need to be taught/transferred to the learners.
  * Next, we'll design the `learning journey` by architecting an instructional blueprint that moves the learners from current state to future state.
  * We'll also articulate specific, measurable `learning objectives` that learners will achieve by the end of the course.


### Applying AI Fluency to Identifying Concepts
#### Delegation
  * Need to decide what I'm doing with the AI and why.
    * Ex: Maybe I already have a few high-level topics in mind. I just need help drilling down on those concepts to an appropriately granular level (apply the ID framework of 4-MAT here: answering `WHAT`, `WHY`, `HOW`, and `WHAT IF`.). I'll list the concept and delegate the task of breaking the concept down following the 4-MAT structure to the AI.
  * I need to know the specific needs and the goal to delegate tasks effectively.
#### Description
  * **Invite** the AI into the conversation.
  * Use the [6 prompting techniques](../AI%20Fluency%20-%20Framework%20&%20Foundations/6_Effective_Prompting_Techniques.pdf)
  * Ex: **Prompt:** I'm building an AI Fluency course for fellow IDs and L&D professionals who need AI fluency, but may be new to AI and anxious about integrating it into their workflows and design processes. Help me think through how identifying concepts that will address these concerns while building confidence.
#### Discernment
  * As the AI generates ideas, this is where I evaluate the product, process, and performance of the AI against my own ID and domain expertise.
  * I act as the `human` in the `human-in-the-loop` validation.
  * I will engage in the *Description <--> Discernment* bridge refining input to achieve maximal output.
#### Diligence
  * I will take responsibility for what ends up in front of the learners and stakeholders.
  * I'm not outsourcing the decisions, I am the ultimate validator.
  * Document key decisions for responsible AI collaboration.
