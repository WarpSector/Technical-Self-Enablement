***For this exercise, I used CoPilot and entered the following prompt based on the exercise instructions.***

**Opening the conversation:**
  * Explain that you're an educator who wants to build a reusable summary of their teaching approach and context
  * Let the AI know this document will help establish shared understanding for future collaborations
  * Indicate you'd like the AI to help you think through all relevant aspects of your teaching practice
  * You can ask the AI to interview you about your teaching, OR
  * You can just start sharing information and ask the AI what else would be helpful to know

**Engineered Prompt:**

I am an instructional designer (which puts me in the "Educator" camp, even though my role is not to teach the content, but to build it and ensure it's aligned
with best practices for adult learning and instructional design). I would like to build a reusable summary of my approach using the ADDIE/4-MAT/Gagne frameworks
for designing and developing courses. I understand that agile ID such as the Successive Approximation Model (SAM) and "minimum viable instruction (MVI)" methodologies
are now becoming more and more popular, so perhaps I'll need a reusable summary just on that as well. These documents will help me establish shared understanding for 
future collaborations and will also allow me to "feed" them into other AI models to accomplish the same thing. I would like you to help me think through all relevant aspects 
of the traditional ADDIE/4-MAT/Gagne unified approach as well as the newer, more in-demand SAM/MVI approach. Feel free to ask me or interview me about my design approach or 
anything else you think would be helpful to know.
