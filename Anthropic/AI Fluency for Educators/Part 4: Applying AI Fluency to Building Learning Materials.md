## AI Fluency for Building Learning Materials and Assignments

### Most of the work is performed in the Description <--> Discernment Loop

You will generally move to this phase after the initial phase of applying the 4D Framework to course design (following ADDIE PM framework, design generally happens before development of materials).
Therefore, your prompts and your collaboration with the AI should be leveraged here - use the context window or if you're starting a new chat, ask your curren collaboration bot that you want to begin a new thread to develop materials and need a detailed summary of the work done in the current thread. Then, you can take that summary and paste it into the new thread for developing materials, refine the context if needed (re: fine-tune) and then engage in `DELEGATION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `DISCERNMENT`, and `DILIGENCE`.

The collaboration with AI is NOT solely about speed. Applying the 4Ds builds coherent and cohesive learning materials that align with learning objectives and actually help learners engage in constructive learning to absorb, practice, and internalize the new information and skill(s). **It is a highly iterative process.** If the AI provides something not aligned or erroneous - correct it so it learns and improves. If it provides output that is good or insightful - reinforce that by telling it so it learns and improves and your collaborative process become tighter.
